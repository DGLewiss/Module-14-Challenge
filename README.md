## Tune the Baseline Trading Algorithm
### Adjusting the size of the Training Dataset
From the analysis there was a large change when increasing the training window to 12 months. With reference to the image above we can observe that the 12 month training window straetgy performance never produced a cumulative return greater than 1.0 aside from in the middle of 2020 June, ending the analysed period on a culumaltive return of approximately 0.9. 


### Adjusting the size of the SMA input Features
When increasing the SMA by 5 times the original model input features we can see a small increase in cumulative returns at the start of the period but otherwise it trades identical to the adjusted training data set. 

### Conclusion of Strategy
From the image above we can observe that the developed strategy did not return a positive return and compared to actual returns despite commencing the assessed period at a greated cumulative return. 

## AdaBoost Strategy
The Adaboost strategy created followed an identicial trend line but completed the assessed period at cumulative returns of 0.9 and peaking at 1.1 in June 2020. The original Strategy provided peaked at the commencement of 2016 and ended the period on returning 0.7. The AdaBoost Strategy performed much better than both of the strategies with altered parameters.
